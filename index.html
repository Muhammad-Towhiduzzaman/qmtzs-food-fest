                <p> 8 Steps Beginners Should Take Before Trying the Keto Diet

                    It depends on which version of keto you’re doing, but generally, you’ll aim to get 5 to 10 percent
                    of your total calories from carbs on the diet. The goal is to consume only 20 to 50 grams (g) of net
                    carbs per day — or less than the equivalent of ½ cup of long-grain brown rice, which contains 25 g
                    of total carbs (and about 23 g net carbs), according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

                <p> Net carbs, which are an unofficial term, are defined as total carbs minus fiber and sugar alcohols,
                    according to the website for the Atkins diet, another low-carb plan. For most people, going that low
